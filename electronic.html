      given there should be referred to as a supplement to this page. Also
      there are a number of interesting "Tips and Tricks"

      Note: please do not contact Stephen Spencer with questions
      regarding IEEE VGTC sponsored conference submissions (i.e. Vis,
      InfoVis, VR, and others). If you have questions
      regarding document formatting, please forward them to <a href="mailto:pvis_papers@pvis.org">pvis_papers@pvis.org</a>.</p>

      <p>
      All papers on the USB (if applicable) will be included in
      Adobe Acrobat Format
      (PDF). Electronic submissions can only be accepted if they are in
       PDF format. We will help you convert Postscript files
      into PDF if you are having difficulty.      </p>

      <p>
      It is recommended that LaTeX be used to format your accepted
      paper. When properly configured LaTeX will produce superior
      output compared to most other popular text formatting
      systems. However some care must be taken to ensure good
      reproduction in the electronic version of the paper. Guidelines
      to this end are given <a href="#latex_info">below</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
      General instructions for producing quality PDF documents from a
      postscript intermediate can be found
<a href="#pdf_creation_info" name="TOCpdf_creation">here</a>.
</p>

<a name="overview" href="#TOCoverview">
<h2>Overview</h2>
</a>

<p>
Here we are primarily concerned with producing PDF documents
that will look good when they are printed as well as when they
are viewed electronically. To this end we wish to ensure that:
</p><ul class="list">
  <li>all fonts are embedded in the document</li>
  <li>no type 3 fonts are used</li>
  <li>all images are high resolution and uncompressed</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Please restrict your fonts to Type 1 fonts. Specifically,
  True type fonts should be avoided and we will not accept
  documents that are composed with Type 3 fonts.</p>


<a name="latex_info" href="#TOClatex">
<h2>Document Formatting with TeX and LaTeX</h2>
</a>

<p> When TeX or LaTeX is used to format documents care must be taken
as to the use of fonts. Specifically, until very recently the default
behaviour when converting the dvi output of TeX to Postscript was to
use non-scalable Type 3 PostScript bitmap fonts to represent the
standard TeX fonts. The resulting document is difficult to read in
electronic form; the type appears fuzzy.</p>

<p>Another problem is that the standard 'base 14' fonts that are
supplied by all software that can render pdf documents turn out to be
not so standard after all. This typically leads to missing math symbols
or ligatures in the printed documents. In order to avoid problems,
these fonts must be embedded in the document. Please read the section
on <a href="#tex_details_info">configuring TeX</a> and set up your
distribution appropriately.</p>

<p> Assuming that dvips is directed to the appropriate font map files,
as described <a href="#tex_details_info">below</a>, a postscript
intermediary file can be created with the following command:
<br><br>
<code>
dvips -t letter -Ppdf -G0 -o papername.ps papername.dvi
</code>
<br><br>
Note that it is a zero following the "-G". The
<code>-Ppdf</code> flag tells dvips to use the config.pdf file.  </p>

<p>If for some reason you had trouble creating a workable .dvipsrc
file, you can instruct dvips to use the download35.map file with the
command
<br><br>
<code>
dvips -t letter -Pdownload35 -G0 -o papername.ps papername.dvi
</code>
<br><br>
With this latter method the other configurations provided by
config.pdf will not be used, but the font mapping is acceptable; there
are no type 3 fonts and ALL fonts are embedded.</p>


<p>Once the document is converted to PDF as described <a href="#pdf_creation_info">below</a>, you should check to ensure that
it contains no Type 3 fonts. This can be done with the
<code>pdffonts</code> utility that is included in the <code><a href="http://www.foolabs.com/xpdf/">Xpdf</a></code>
package. Alternatively, you can use the
<code>File-&gt;Document_Properties-&gt;Fonts</code> option in Acrobat
Reader, although this seems to be somewhat less reliable especially if
Reader has more than one document open.  If the base 14 fonts (Times
New Roman, Symbol, etc.) are not embedded in the document, then the
appropriate font map file was not used. Please make sure that you have
a recent distribution of Tex and have followed the instructions for
setting it up as described <a href="#tex_details_info">below</a>.</p><p>

</p><p>
Documents formatted with Type 3 bitmap fonts will not be accepted.</p>

<a name="pdftex_info" href="#TOCpdftex">
<h3>From TeX to PDF</h3>
</a>

<p>
A standard way to produce a PDF document from TeX source is to create
a dvi file and then convert that to Postscript using the command
<br><br>
<code>
dvips -t letter -Ppdf -G0 -o papername.ps papername.dvi
</code>
<br><br>
mentioned <a href="#latex_info">above</a>. This Postscript document
can then be converted to PDF as described <a href="#pdf_creation_info">below</a>.</p>

<p>Note that scripts such as <code>dvipdf</code> which ostensibly
bypass the Postscript intermediary should not be used since they
generally do not instruct <code>dvips</code> to use the
<code>config.pdf</code> file.</p>

<p> Another alternative is to use the <code>pdflatex</code>
(<code>pdftex</code>) program instead of straight LaTeX or TeX. This
program avoids the Type 3 font problem, however you must ensure that
all of the fonts are embedded (the <code>pdffonts</code> utility
mentioned <a href="#latex_info">above</a> will yield this
information). If they are not, you need to configure
<code>pdftex</code> to use a font map file that specifies that the
fonts be embedded. Also you should ensure that images are not
downsampled or otherwise compressed in a lossy way. If you are
knowledgeable about how pdflatex deals with included images and how to
ensure that they are not compressed or downsampled, please email us at
<a href="mailto:pvis_papers@pvis.org">pvis_papers@pvis.org</a> so that we might
improve our support for this program.  </p>


<a name="tex_details_info" href="#TOCtex_details">
<h3>Configuring TeX / dvips</h3>
</a>

<p> It is essential that your TeX distribution has the facilities to
create PDF documents without type 3 fonts. In addition, we need to
configure the system so that the base 14 fonts are embedded in the
document. Only very recent distributions of TeX provide anything close
to a convenient mechanism for achieving this. In particular, the
following instructions apply to teTeX-2.0, TeXlive2003 and/or MikTeX
but not to earlier distributions.</p>

<p>We recommend that the final document be produced by
latex-&gt;dvips-&gt;ps2pdf since that enables explicit control over how
fonts and images are managed. We are not sure that the default
settings for pdftex do not result in downsampled or compressed
images.</p>

<p>In order to ensure that no type 3 fonts are used and that all
fonts, including the base 14 fonts, are embedded we must reference an
appropriate font map file. One such file is provided for pdftex and is
called pdftex_dl14.map. This is the one that we recommend; it works
fine for dvips. There is also a file called download35.map, that is
specifically made for dvips. It seems to also produces acceptable
documents. Both of these files are only available in the recent
distributions mentioned above.</p>

<p>We have tested the following distributions:

</p><p><b><u>Unix/Linux: teTeX-2.0, TeX Live 2003</u></b>

</p><ul class="list"> 
  <li> Install the latest version of Ghostscript from
    <a href="http://www.ghostscript.com/">http://www.ghostscript.com/</a>
    <br>This will come with the latest version of ps2pdf.

  </li><li> Install the latest teTeX distribution from
        <a href="http://www.tug.org/teTeX/">http://www.tug.org/teTeX/</a>
       <br> or the latest TeX Live distribution from
        <a href="http://texlive.sarovar.org/">http://texlive.sarovar.org/</a>

  </li><li>There are a few different ways to instruct dvips to use an
    appropriate font map file.  The easiest is to create a file called
    <code>.dvipsrc</code> in your home directory with a line specifying
    which font map file to use. The line will look something like this:
    <br>
    <code>
    p +/usr/local/TeX_Live_2003/texmf/fonts/map/pdftex/updmap/pdftex_dl14.map
    </code>
    <br>
    However you must change the path name so that it is right for your
    distribution. (On MacOSX this can typically be found at
    <code>/sw/share/texmf/dvips/config/pdftex_dl14.map</code>)</li>
</ul>

<p><b><u>Windows: MiKTeX</u></b>

</p><ul class="list">
  <li> Install the latest version of Ghostscript from
    <a href="http://www.ghostscript.com/">http://www.ghostscript.com/</a>
    <br>This will come with the latest version of ps2pdf.

  </li><li> Install the latest MiKTeX distribution from
    <a href="http://www.miktex.org/">http://www.miktex.org/</a>

  </li><li> You will need to insert the line
    <br>
    <code>
    p +download35.map
    </code>
    <br>
    into the file <code>c:/texmf/dvips/config/config.pdf</code>.
    However you must change the path name so that it is right for your
    distribution.</li>
</ul>


<!--
<p>If you use pdf(la)tex, you can also configure it to embed the base
14 fonts.  In the web2c directory of your TeX distribution, you will
find a file named updmap.cfg. In it make sure that you have
pdftexDownloadBase14 true. Then run the updmap script; this will
ensure that the file pdftex.map specifies that the base 14 fonts will
be embedded by pdftex. Note that this procedure requires administrator
access to your TeX distribution. If you do not have administrator
access, you must instruct pdftex to use the map file called
pdftex_dl14.map (see the pdftex documentation). You can learn more by
following <a
href="http://tug.org/mailman/htdig/pdftex/2004-February/thread.html#4763">

<h2>MS Word and Other Document Creation Software</h2>
</a>

<p>
Independent of the application used to create the document, the final
PDF file can be created from a postscript intermediate as discussed
<a href="#pdf_creation_info">below</a>. On most applications
that are running on MS Windows, a postscript file can be created
by selecting a postscript printer driver and then printing to a file.
</p>

<p>
If MS Word is used to create the document, it is possible to print the
result directly to Adobe Acrobat Distiller. It is important to set the
proper Distiller job options. In order to do so, please download and
install the Adobe Acrobat Distiller job
options file from <a href="http://junctionpublishing.org/vgtc/Templates/tph_pdfsettings.joboptions.zip">here.</a></p>

<p>
Please use that job options file when creating PDF documents in Acrobat
Distiller (Version 5.0 will work with Acrobat
Distiller 7.0.). The  job options file provided embeds all typefaces
and does not downsample or subsample images when creating the PDF document.</p>

<p>
To create a PDF document from FrameMaker it is necessary to
create a postscript intermediate because the Distiller job
options cannot be manipulated from within FrameMaker itself.
</p>



<a name="pdf_creation_info" href="#TOCpdf_creation">
<h2>Creating PDF Files From Postscript</h2>
</a>

<p>
In order to produce a camera ready PDF document it is essential
that images are stored at a sufficiently high resolution and
that no lossy compression is used during the PDF creation
process. Steve Spencer gives the following rule of thumb: The
resolution of the image in pixels should be 300 times the size
of the image in inches as it appears in the document. So for
example a 2 inch by 3 inch image should have a resolution of at
least 600 by 900.
</p>

<p>
The standard tool for creating PDF documents is "Adobe Acrobat
Distiller". We recommend using Adobe Acrobat Distiller setting found <a href="http://junctionpublishing.org/vgtc/Templates/tph_pdfsettings.joboptions.zip">here</a>. </p>

<!--
These tips are also applicable to the 
<a href = "http://createpdf.adobe.com/">online services</a> at
Adobe's site (free for five PDF creation jobs).
-->

<p>
Another acceptable PDF creation tool is ps2pdf. A number of flags need
to be passed to ps2pdf to preserve the quality of the images in the
final document:
<br><br>
<code>
ps2pdf -sPAPERSIZE=letter \<br>
-dMaxSubsetPct=100 -dCompatibilityLevel=1.3 \<br>
-dSubsetFonts=true -dEmbedAllFonts=true \<br>
-dAutoFilterColorImages=false \<br>
-dAutoFilterGrayImages=false \<br>
-dColorImageFilter=/FlateEncode \<br>
-dGrayImageFilter=/FlateEncode \<br>
-dMonoImageFilter=/FlateEncode \<br>
papername.ps papername.pdf
</code>
</p>

<p>
(Please note, that the <code>FlateEncode</code> switch doesn't seem
to work under MiKTeX. We are currently looking into this.)
</p>

<p>
There are other tools available for creating PDF documents, however some
of them, such as PDFWriter, do not give the user sufficient control
over the document creation process to produce an acceptable
result. It is important that images be kept at a sufficiently high
resolution and that all fonts that are used be embedded in the PDF
document.
