<!--
<p>
This document contains instructions for the formatting and submission of
supplemental material for inclusion on the DVD-ROM publication of the IEEE
Visualization Proceedings.&nbsp;
-->

<p>
"Supplemental material" is additional material which is used to support
your main submission. This material
can include, but is not restricted to, images, QuickTime or MPEG animations,
source code, PDF with embedded multimedia and HTML or VRML presentations. You are encouraged but not
required to submit supplemental material.&nbsp;

</p><p>**Please note that the IEEE digital library *<strong>requires</strong>*<strong> the inclusion of README and SUMMARY</strong> files with all supplemental material. To help avoid delays in getting the material into the digital library, please include these files with all supplemental material. Please read the <a href="#documenting_info" name="TOCdocumenting">Documentation
of Supplemental Material</a> section below for more detail.
</p><p>If your event creates a USB, due to space limitations, supplemental material is not guaranteed to
be included on the USB. In the event that material must be left out,
the production chair will make the decision; larger files are more likely
to be excluded. In all cases, we will contact the authors to let them know before any files are left off of the USB proceedings. 
</p><p>If you choose to submit supplemental material to enhance your main submission,
you will need to prepare this material in accordance with the guidelines
presented in this document and submit it together with your accepted publication
(paper, tutorial, panel, etc.).</p><p>If you are submitting supplemental material and your conference has a USB, it would be very helpful
  if you wrap it all in html and call the main html file "index.htm". We
  will create the link from the USB stream to that file.
  
  <br><a name="delivery_info" href="#TOCdelivery"></a>
</p><h2>
<a href="#TOCdelivery" name="delivery_info">Delivery Information</a></h2>

<p>
If you have more than one file to submit, use an archive-creation tool
("pkzip" on PCs, "tar" on UNIX) and create <b>a single</b> archive file
to be delivered.&nbsp;

<!--
<p>Please follow the instructions on the <a href="submit.html">submit page</a>
in order to submit this file 
for inclusion on the DVD-ROM Proceedings of
the IEEE Visualization Conference.-->

<!--
<p>If you would like to give us a URL to have a link included into the
multimedia content browser of the DVD-Rom, please send this weblink to
"jhm@chpc.utah.edu". All other supplemental material should be 
submitted on the <a href="submit.html">submit page</a>.
-->
<!--
<p>If you have problems submitting your material, please contact <a href="mailto:pvis_papers@pvis.org">pvis_papers@pvis.org</a>.&nbsp;

<br><a name="copyright_info" href="#TOCcopyright"></a>
</p><h2>
<a href="#TOCcopyright" name="copyright_info">Copyright Information</a></h2>
<p>
All material used by the author in their supplemental material must have
proper copyright clearance. If you are unsure of the copyright status of
particular images, sounds, or video clips used in your supplemental material,
please contact <a href="mailto:pvis_papers@pvis.org">pvis_papers@pvis.org</a>
immediately.&nbsp;
<br><a name="format_info" href="#TOCformat"></a>
</p><h2>
<a href="#TOCformat" name="format_info">File Formats</a></h2>
<p>
As mentioned above, supplemental material can include a number of different
formats: images, source code, HTML presentations, multimedia presentations,
PDF with embedded multimedia and Quicktime or MPEG animations. There are a few guidelines which should
be followed when submitting supplemental material of specific types.&nbsp;
<br><a name="image_fmt" href="#TOCimage_fmt"></a>
</p><h3>
<a href="#TOCimage_fmt" name="image_fmt">Still Images</a></h3>
<p>
The preferred format for still images is TIFF. JPEG and GIF images are
acceptable, though the image quality will not be as high as with TIFF.
If you do submit TIFF images, please make sure they are not LZW-compressed.&nbsp;
<br><a name="movie_fmt" href="#TOCmovie_fmt"></a>
</p><h3>
<a href="#TOCmovie_fmt" name="movie_fmt">Animations / Video</a></h3>
<p>
Animations will be accepted in MPEG (<b>.mpg</b>), QuickTime (<b>.mov</b>)
or AVI (<b>.avi</b>) file formats. In the interests of producing a USB
that is as platform agnostic as possible, codecs should be chosen as follows:&nbsp;
</p><dl>
<dt>
.mpg&nbsp;</dt>

<dd>
mpeg 1/2 or motion jpeg</dd>

<dt>
.mov</dt>

<dd>
Cinepak (do <b>not</b> use the Sorensen codec)</dd>

<dt>
.avi</dt>

<dd>
mpeg 2 or DivX (or OpenDivX)</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Please note, that these videos will simply appear as a file in the
HTML directory structure of the USB. 
<br><a name="text_fmt" href="#TOCtext_fmt"></a>
</p>
<h3>
<a href="#TOCtext_fmt" name="text_fmt">Papers and Presentations</a></h3>
<p>
Documents such as these should be submitted in Adobe Acrobat (<strong>.pdf</strong>) format. Tips on converting
documents to Adobe Acrobat format can be found <a href="electronic.html">here</a>.&nbsp;
</p><p>You are encouraged to submit an additional electronic verison of your submission as a PDF with embedded multimedia, such as video and 3D objects. Adobe Acrobat Pro 7 and newer easily allow for  embedding of objects in a PDF file. See 'Tools' --&gt; 'Multimedia' in the Adobe Acrobat menu. 

For further instruction, please reference <a href="http://help.adobe.com/en_US/Acrobat/9.0/Professional/WS58a04a822e3e50102bd615109794195ff-7c16.w.html">http://help.adobe.com/en_US/Acrobat/9.0/Professional/WS58a04a822e3e50102bd615109794195ff-7c16.w.html</a>.
</p><p>File size must be 
  minimized and download time must be considered. We recommend files not 
  exceed 50MB and that authors submit files that play on any platform 
  (Windows, Linux, Mac OS). Files larger than 50MB may be returned for 
  modification to make them smaller. 
</p><p>These electonic PDFs will be included as Supplemental Material in the DL and, if your conference has one, the USB. <br>
      <a name="browser_fmt" href="#TOCbrowser_fmt"></a>
</p><h3>
<a href="#TOCbrowser_fmt" name="browser_fmt">HTML, VRML, and Java</a></h3>
<p>
HTML presentations, VRML presentations, and Java presentations are acceptable
as supplemental material. There are two very important guidelines to follow,
however:&nbsp;
</p><ol>
<li>
your presentation should not require links to external resources for navigation
elements (buttons, images, or other artwork)&nbsp;</li>

<li>
the ISO-9660 file naming format must be followed. Presentations which do
not conform to the "8.3" naming format will not be processed or placed
on the USB. (For more information, please see the "File and Directory
Naming" section below.)&nbsp;</li>
</ol>

<p><br>It is suggested that authors prepare "zip" or "tar" archives of
material that does not conform to the "8.3" file naming formats for inclusion
as supplemental material, and instructions for the user on the preparation
of that material.&nbsp;
<a name="naming_info" href="#TOCnaming"></a>
</p><h2>
<a href="#TOCnaming" name="naming_info">File and Directory Naming</a></h2>
<p>
The USB publications follow the ISO 9660 Level 1 standard, in order
to support as many computer platforms as possible.&nbsp;
</p><p>Certain guidelines must be followed when naming file and directories
under the ISO 9660 standard:&nbsp;
</p><ol>
<li>
Filenames are limited to eight <b>lower-case</b> letters, a period, and
a three-character file extension. The extension is optional.&nbsp;</li>

<li>
Filenames must contain only <b>lower-case</b> letters, numbers, and the
underscore character.&nbsp;</li>

<li>
Directory names are limited to eight <b>lower-case</b> letters.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>

<p>
The following examples show valid and invalid filenames:&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%">
<tbody><tr valign="TOP">
<td width="30%"><u>VALID</u>
<br>sponge.doc&nbsp;

</p><h2>
<a href="#TOCdocumenting" name="documenting_info">Documentation of Supplemental
Material</a></h2>
<p>Authors who submit supplementary  electronic content with their papers (called �extended objects� for brevity) <strong>MUST</strong> provide a README file and a  SUMMARY file with their material. 
</p><p><strong>As of the end of May 2013</strong>, the inclusion of these files is *mandatory* if you have supplemental material and nothing will be uploaded to the digital library until these files are received. 
</p><p>The most up to date information required in the readme file can be found under<br>
  <a href="http://www.ieee.org/publications_standards/publications/services/services_resources.html" target="_blank">http://www.ieee.org/publications_standards/publications/services/services_resources.html</a><br>
  Specifications &gt; Supplemental electronic material (multimedia) overview (zip file)<br>
  <br>
  There are two basic types of author-submitted extended objects (aka: Supplementary Material): 1) playable files (such as .au, .midi, .mov, .mp3, .mpeg,  .wav, etc.), and 2) data set or collections of extended. Playable files require some sort of client player software and are usually fairly straightforward to use. Data sets are inherently more complex, consisting of raw data, often with an  accompanying program(s) to manipulate the data. It appears that you submitted playable extended object(s). The  requirements for playable extended object submission are described below: <br>
  <br>
  For playable extended objects, the author <strong>README</strong> file must include the following sections: <br>
  <br>
  a. <strong>Description</strong>: An overall description of the objects and what the audience can expect to gain by  downloading them; <br>
  b. <strong>Size</strong>: The total size of all objects, in kilobytes if less than one megabyte in size, or in megabytes if one  megabyte or greater in size. This will allow IEEE to provide IEEE Xplore users with information that will  help them to make downloading decisions; <br>
  c. <strong>Player Information</strong>: Provide the minimum version of the player software that is required to play the  submitted files. Include the name of the software, the version number, and any special requirements for the  player. For non-standard applications, please include what platform(s) is required along with more detailed  information about interacting with these objects; <br>
  d. <strong>Extended Object List</strong>: A complete list of all the files included in the set of extended objects; <br>
  e. <strong>Contact Information</strong>: The author should provide contact information in case users have questions  regarding the extended material. IEEE will not provide any technical support. <br>
  <br>
  For playable extended objects, the author <strong>SUMMARY</strong> file must: <br>
  a. <strong>Describe</strong> in 5 sentences or less the contents or value of the extended objects. This file helps IEEE Xplore  users to make downloading decisions. <br>
  <br>
  Please make sure that the README file is in PDF or text format so that it is available to the widest possible  audience of readers. Please make sure that the SUMMARY file is in text format. Other formats may delay processing  your paper. <br>
  <br>
  IEEE staff will make sure that all files are loaded, but will not provide support to readers on how to use  the materials or troubleshoot them if there are problems. Therefore, it is important that the README file contain complete instructions for using the supplemental files and that all files work properly. <br>
  <br>
  When you are done, <strong>ZIP </strong>the README and SUMMARY files with your Supplementary Material.
